## Microcopy Quick Reference

Microcopy refers to the small bits of text throughout your interface that guide users and help them complete tasks.

### Button Labels

- **Action-oriented**: Start with a verb
- **Specific**: "Create account" not "Submit"
- **Outcome-focused**: "Download report" not "Click here"
- **Match user intent**: What users want to do, not what the business wants

### Form Labels

- **Clear and concise**: No unnecessary words
- **No jargon**: Use plain language
- **Descriptive**: "Email address" not "Email"
- **Above the field**: For accessibility

### Tooltips

- **Brief explanations**: Under 2 sentences
- **For complex features**: Only when truly needed
- **Provide context**: Not instructions
- **Example**: "API Key: Unique identifier for authenticating requests"

### Placeholder Text

- **Example format**: Show what goes in the field
- **Not instructions**: "name@example.com" not "Enter your email"
- **Realistic examples**: Use actual example data
- **Don't replace labels**: Placeholders disappear when typing

### Error Messages

- **Say what happened**: "Payment declined"
- **Say why** (if helpful): "Your card was declined by your bank"
- **Say what to do next**: "Try a different card or contact your bank"
- **Human tone**: Not robotic or blaming

### Empty States

- **Explain what will appear**: "Projects will appear here"
- **Guide to action**: "Create your first project"
- **Encouraging tone**: Helpful, not negative
- **Clear CTA**: Specific next step

### Confirmation Messages

- **Confirm what happened**: "Changes saved"
- **Provide next steps**: "View your profile"
- **Include undo option**: For reversible actions
- **Brief and positive**: Short, encouraging

### Onboarding Copy

- **Welcome without overwhelming**: Keep it simple
- **One concept at a time**: Don't introduce multiple features at once
- **Action-oriented**: Do, not just read
- **Allow skipping**: Don't force users through everything
